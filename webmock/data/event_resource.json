id=\"story_continues_1\">Pupils from a Tottenham school have released a song composed in the aftermath of last year's riots. </p>\n<p>Everybody Dreams was written by children from Gladesmore Community School in north London in response to the negative image of their area.</p>\n<p>The song has received backing from more than 100 celebrities, including DJ Chris Moyles, and has been remixed by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics.</p>\n<p>Teachers hope to establish a school orchestra with the proceeds from sales.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Council's hold music</span>\n<p>Deputy head teacher Juliet Coley said the children's ambition from the start had been for the song to reach number one once it goes on general release on Monday, but she added that it was up against Justin Bieber's As Long As You Love Me.</p>\n<p>The reach of the song has astounded Ms Coley.</p>\n<p>It has been sung by London Mayor Boris Johnson while he was on a visit to the school, it is being used as Haringey Council's hold music, the single will be played at Tottenham Hotspur FC's first game next weekend and Stephen Fry has tweeted his four million followers encouraging them to buy it.</p>\n<p>The song has been backed by celebrities from Nigerian rapper Wizkid to comedians Jennifer Saunders and Ricky Gervais.</p>\n<p>The family of Mark Duggan who was shot by police on 4 August in Tottenham sparking the 2011 summer riots has also backed the single.</p>\n<p>It is also backed by the Metropolitan Police, with PC Ken Egbuniwe taking part in the video.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'It's surreal'</span>\n<p>On 7 August last year, petrol bombs were thrown at police, cars were set on fire and buildings were looted.</p>\n<p>Ms Coley explained that the desire to correct the public's impression of Tottenham inspired the children.</p>\n<p>She said: \"When the kids came back to school after the riots they were really upset by images in the media.</p>\n<p>\"The riots started in Tottenham and it was the last place that got cleaned up. </p>\n<p>\"You could still see the debris and burnt out parked cars.</p>\n<p>\"The idea of a song came up because they thought it could move people.</p>\n<p>\"We wanted to give the kids aspirations to think big and think anything is possible.\"</p>\n<p>But the success of the song has surprised everyone involved.</p>\n<p>\"On pre-orders we are at 33 in the album chart. One Direction's at 31. It's surreal,\" Ms Coley said.</p>\n<p>She hopes the proceeds from the sale of the single can be used to fund a school orchestra, anticipated to cost at least &pound;20,000.</p>\n<p>\"We want to do something beyond the expectation of kids in Tottenham,\" Ms Coley said.</p>\n<p>\"We want to make classical music in an urban setting but that costs and we've never been able to afford it.\"</p>\n","updatedAt":1345376340,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Pupils from a Tottenham school have released a song composed in the aftermath of last year's riots.

id=\"story_continues_1\">As the dust settled on London's riot torn streets last summer the politicians were out pounding them and making promises. </p>\n<p>One such promise came as Mayor Boris Johnson and the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles visited Tottenham, not just to see the damage for themselves, but to offer up money to rebuild those areas of London that had suffered. </p>\n<p>Between them they promised &pound;70m from the Mayor's Regeneration Fund - &pound;20m from the government to help Tottenham and Croydon and &pound;50m from the mayor to go to councils affected by the riots. </p>\n<p>A year on, BBC London asked the mayor how much money had gone from City Hall to the councils to help the rebuilding work. </p>\n<p>His answer could not have been clearer.</p>\n<p>\"All of it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>When it was pointed out that we had spoken to all the councils who were in line for money and all had said they had not received any money yet - although they were bidding to fund projects - he continued:  \"That's not my information at all. </p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\">\"My information is that the funds that we've made available, virtually all of it has gone, or certainly gone out the door.</p>\n<p>\"All I can tell you is that the bulk of the &pound;70m has been spent, or indeed all of the &pound;70m has been spent. As far as I know we've pushed the money out of the door. My information is that projects are now moving.\"</p>\n<p>That is not the case, however. </p>\n<p>City Hall later confirmed that no money had yet been passed to the councils, but went on to clarify exactly what had been going on with the Mayor's Regeneration Fund.</p>\n<p>In fact &pound;17m has reached phase one of the process, a kind of outline permission, in which councils may be asked to come back with more detail about exactly how they want to spend the money.</p>\n<p>The remaining &pound;53m is at phase two, which means it has been approved and allocated to specific projects in the relevant council areas. </p>\n<p>It will, in short, be spent on regeneration projects in the affected areas, with the first money expected to go out from City Hall this autumn.</p>\n<p>In Southwark, which saw parts of Peckham hit by the rioters, there are plans to redevelop Peckham Rye station. </p>\n<p>Money from the mayor's fund will be matched by the local authority. It was something the council had planned to do  further down the line, but the mayor's fund has given it the chance to do it sooner. </p>\n<p>It has not had any hard cash yet though.</p>\n<p>Council leader, Labour councillor Peter John said: \"We're working with the mayor to deliver things. </p>\n<p>\"I think it would have been good if the mayor could have delivered projects which really delivered immediately in the aftermath of the riots rather than two or three years on and I don't think we really saw that across London. </p>\n<p>\"There was nothing the mayor did that was branded in a sort of mayor's way and I think that's disappointing.\"</p>\n<p>However, he will still welcome the money when it comes through as will his Conservative counterpart in Croydon, councillor Mike Fisher.</p>\n<p>Croydon also has plans to regenerate local areas and help boost businesses.</p>\n<p>Mr Fisher said: \"What we're getting is regional money from the mayor Boris Johnson to put into Croydon but it's about local knowledge and making sure that local people, local business, local groups are involved in how that money is spent.\"   </p>\n","updatedAt":1344365280,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"As the dust settled on London's riot torn streets last summer the politicians were out pounding them and making promises.

cities in England in what was the biggest display of civil unrest in the UK for 30 years.</p>\n<p class=\"introduction\"><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866\">More than 3,000 people were arrested</a> in connection with the unrest, which saw streets in parts of the country awash with looting, arson and violence. </p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">One year on, what are the recollections of those affected and what has been the impact on their lives?</p>\n<p>The summer riots of 2011 began after Mark Duggan was shot dead by the police.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old father-of-four was shot on 4 August in Tottenham, north London.</p>\n<p>Within days riots broke out in Tottenham, which then spread to other parts of London and were mirrored in other cities in England to form the worst disorder of a generation.</p>\n<p>The findings of a recent survey suggest <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18653530\">police officers caught up in the riots were woefully outnumbered,</a> leaving many fearing for their lives.</p>\n<p>In Tottenham, the epicentre of the initial disturbances, five buildings were gutted by fire.</p>\n<p>The local post office was among the burned out sites. </p>\n<p>But within months Vipin Rao, who owns the local branch, had set up again in a new premises nearby.</p>\n<p>One year on, he has a message of defiance for those who threatened his livelihood.</p>\n<p>\"I always wanted to tell people who did the riot that you can destroy the building but you cannot destroy our soul, our willingness to serve the customers, our willingness to serve the community and we will come back again,\" he said. </p>\n<p>Some of the businesses on Tottenham's high street say they still have not received adequate compensation, but the government says the vast majority of claims have finally now been settled. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Haringey Council has revealed that 5,000 jobs could be created under its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19078471\">plans to revitalise Tottenham</a>.</p>\n<p>The plan, which is the <a href=\"http://www.haringey.gov.uk/vision-for-tottenham-unveiled.htm\">council's vision for the area until 2025,</a> also involves building 10,000 new homes by 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">Mother-of-two Graciela Watson could only watch from her window as youths went on the rampage in her road in Hackney, east London.</p>\n<p>Youths clashed with police and set bins on fire on what had hitherto been a quiet residential street. </p>\n<p>\"At the time it was scary - they were outside our house,\" she said. </p>\n<p>\"It didn't feel that their agenda was political. It felt like an excuse to vent frustrations. I think it was a lot of young people having a laugh. Since then it's been fine. There's been no trouble.</p>\n<p>\"There are still posters up around here and adverts in the Hackney Gazette but I don't recognise any of the youths who were on the streets.\" </p>\n<p>Life quickly returned to normal and \"those who enjoy living in the area\" united behind the clean-up operation. </p>\n<p>\"If anything, it brought the community together. One shop was badly damaged and there was a response to raise money for them. Thousands was raised which paid for a new shop front and replaced stock that had been lost.\" </p>\n<p>And the freelance video producer says that, despite last year's unrest, the area she has lived in for the last six years is continuing to change for the better.</p>\n<p>\"Hackney is going through a huge period of regeneration and there's pride in the area. It's attracting younger, wealthier people to the area.\"</p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">Jimi Jagne was on the streets of Toxteth in 1981. He was part of the wave of public disorder that swept the streets of inner city Liverpool. </p>\n<p>Thirty years later, he was back on those streets for another riot. But this time he was talking to young people, urging them to go home and not get involved in the unrest. </p>\n<p>The youth and community worker was among a group of between 10 and 30 people, called Toxteth Against Riots, who went out on the streets in bright yellow vests over a two week period. </p>\n<p>\"We wanted to do anything we could to get them off the streets. </p>\n<p>\"Young people were travelling across the city - across the River Mersey - to cause trouble in Toxteth because of its reputation from 1981. </p>\n<p>\"We held public meetings attended by up to 300 people and then a small group went out on the streets. We carried on for two weeks because we remembered the previous riots which reignited after a brief hiatus.\"</p>\n<p>Mr Jagne says a separate group, which goes under a different name, was set up following the success of Toxteth Against Riots. It devises initiatives aimed at benefiting young people and has secured funding. </p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">Ajay Bhatia runs Machan Express coffee shop, in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, which suffered almost &pound;20,000 of damage and lost more than &pound;15,000 of stock during the disturbances.</p>\n<p>Mr Bhatia, who was visited by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the immediate aftermath of the riots, says he had decided to sell his business this May, nine months after the riots.</p>\n<p>The pressure of rebuilding his business had started to take its toll.  </p>\n<p>\"It's been a struggle to get insurance claims sorted and rebuild. And business hasn't been good. The bills don't stop - we still have to pay them. </p>\n<p>\"It's been a big shock mentally, physically and financially. </p>\n<p>\"We haven't had any major problems with the young people since the riots.</p>\n<p>\"I decided to shut down the business because nobody was coming forward to help us. But the bank has stepped in to provide an overdraft facility and we've been given a small business loan.\"</p>\n<p>But he has since decided to persevere and keep the business going amid signs that development in the area might turn his fortunes around in years to come. </p>\n<p>\"A new school is opening in September nearby with 200 pupils starting in September and a further 700 next year. It's a two-minute walk away. That will improve footfall. And there are plans to build a new hotel.</p>\n<p>\"Local development is the key. There has been none in the area for about five years. The government needs to encourage people who want to invest in the Jewellery Quarter. Most of the shops in the area are up for sale.\"</p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">\"Before the riots we tried to get help to fund our workshops which build relationships between young people and the police through role playing,\" says youth worker Kelly Reid.</p>\n<p>\"The workshops give young people the opportunity to speak to the police and ask them about their work, rather than meeting in more volatile and hostile situations. </p>\n<p>\"We had a team of 12 youth workers which was cut to six last April. We also ran a club for up to 60 young people twice a week which had to close in June last year.</p>\n<p>\"We warned about the effects of cutting funding. Since the riots we've been able to obtain more funding from the Metropolitan Police, who have been really good.\"</p>\n<p>She says a lot of youngsters she works with, who had been on the periphery of a group but had not actively engaged in violence or looting, were severely punished. </p>\n<p>Many who were involved now regret getting caught up in the frenzy, she says -  a feeling which is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18648920\">echoed elsewhere</a> anecdotally. </p>\n<p>\"Everybody has to face up to consequences but a lot of young people were just in the area and now have a criminal record.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think riots will happen again because the police came down hard on people. The young people know about the consequences of their actions and they know not to act in the same way again. </p>\n<p>\"Of course, it would've been better if it hadn't happened in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"introduction\">The riots will always remain etched in Kevin Marshall's mind. </p>\n<p>His younger brother, an engineering student, was shot twice in the chest during an unprovoked attack in Upper Brockley, south-east London, the day before riots broke out in Tottenham. </p>\n<p>Mr Marshall believes the timing of the attack wasn't a coincident. There was already a febrile atmosphere in \"certain communities\" after Mark Duggan was shot, he says. </p>\n<p>The London he describes was a tinderbox on the verge of being set alight. </p>\n<p>During the riots, the marketing executive from Greenwich, south-east London, regularly travelled through the worst-hit parts of south London to visit loved ones. </p>\n<p>He spent time with his brother at a hospital in Camberwell, while looters took to the streets of nearby Peckham, visited his parents at their home near Croydon and checked that his Clapham-based girlfriend was safe too. </p>\n<p>\"I saw people kicking in newsagent shops and setting cars on fire. It was like a war zone. I felt scared and angry. What do you do if the police aren't doing anything?\"</p>\n<p>Mr Marshall, 28, said he also felt acutely aware of his race during the riots.</p>\n<p>\"A year ago people looked at me clearly wondering whether I would start trouble. The riots weren't a black issue, it was a youth issue, but there were clear undertones.\"</p>\n<p>His response was to set up an online discussion programme for young people in his spare time.</p>\n<p>Launched in late August, in the immediate aftermath of the unrest, Pandora's Box is broadcast every fortnight. </p>\n<p>\"It was sad to see youths being allowed to run wild but it made me realise we need to listen to what the kids are saying.\"</p>\n","updatedAt":1344244200,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"It is one year since riots spread across cities in England in what was the biggest display of civil unrest in the UK for 30 years.","volume":null,"isNew":false,"image":{"class":"Image","src":"/news/uk-19077349/images/62007000/jpg/_62007747_62006638.jpg","alt":"Firefighters battle a large fire that broke out in shops and residential properties in Croydon ","origin":"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/62007000/jpg/_62007747_62006638.jpg","resizer":{},"sectionPath":[],"section":null},"byline":"Alexis Akwagyiram","bylineTitle":"BBC News","relatedIndexes":[{"class":"Index","title":"Features and Analysis","updatedAt":null,"stories":[{"class":"Story","id":"uk-18681866","title":"Who's been prosecuted?","body":null,"updatedAt":null,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Statistical breakdown of rioters who have so far appeared in court and the sentences that have been handed down.

class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">Prison sentences totalling almost 2,000 years have been handed out to rioters following the UK-wide disorder which began exactly a year ago.</p>\n<p>Riots and looting began in Tottenham, north London, on 7 August 2011 after police shot Mark Duggan.</p>\n<p>It swiftly spread to the rest of the country, becoming the worst public disorder for a generation.</p>\n<p>A year on from the unrest, Ministry of Justice figures show that a total of 1,292 offenders have been jailed for their part in the trouble.</p>\n<p>The average custodial sentence was 16.8 months - more than four times the average term handed down by magistrates' courts for similar offences.</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\">It means courts have issued approximately 1,808 years of sentences to rioters.</p>\n<p>In an interview with BBC London to mark a year since the riots, the Crown Prosecution Service's chief prosecutor Alison Saunders backed the swift and tough justice meted out to culprits.</p>\n<p>She said: \"One thing we also learned in the disorder is that if we can get people in court fast and get them sentenced it acts as a deterrent - it made people think twice. </p>\n<p>\"I do think the criminal justice response was particularly important. People could see there were consequences. </p>\n<p>\"They could see the criminal justice system responding and that sent a really strong message from society that this was unacceptable.\"</p>\n<p>The riots were the single biggest challenge the Crown Prosecution Service has ever faced.</p>\n<p>Ms Saunders said at the height of the caseload, paperwork on rioters was coming in \"literally by the sackful\".</p>\n<p>Courts opened overnight to clear the backlog with prosecutors from across the region travelling to London to help out.</p>\n<p>Even Ms Saunders herself had to carry out prosecutions.</p>\n<p>She said: \"I hadn't been in court for seven years. </p>\n<p>\"It really was back to the coalface.\"</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_3\">\"The London prosecutors particularly were saying: 'This is going on in our city - we want to volunteer, and we want to get London back on its feet'.\"</p>\n<p>A year on, the CPS is still dealing with approximately 10 riot-related cases a week.</p>\n<p>Some 308 defendants still face live proceedings over their alleged roles in the mayhem.</p>\n<p>\"It is definitely the largest operation the CPS has ever done,\" Ms Saunders said.</p>\n<p>A specialised unit was set up to deal with riot offences comprising of 30 staff, including 10 prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Ms Saunders said there was no end to the riot-related prosecutions in sight, although the CPS hoped that the majority of the work would be complete by the end of 2012.</p>\n<p>However, Ms Saunders admitted some rioters would never be caught.

id=\"story_continues_1\">An in-depth study into the experiences of police officers caught up in last summer's riots reveals that they were woefully outnumbered, leaving many in fear of their lives.</p>\n<p>In London they were so stretched that some volunteer police without riot training or gear joined the front line. </p>\n<p>But radio problems meant riot police from other areas were held back and not deployed to deal with the violence.</p>\n<p>Some 130 officers police took part in the LSE-Guardian newspaper study.</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\">The BBC's Newsnight programme has had exclusive access to the results of the study, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">Reading the Riots.</a></p>\n<p>It involved interviews, most of them conducted anonymously, with officers of every rank who were deployed during the unrest in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Salford and Liverpool.</p>\n<p>Their accounts reveal that:</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Rioters with machetes'</span>\n<p>The riots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, and subsequently spread to other parts of the capital and other English cities.</p>\n<p>Four consecutive nights of looting and arson left five people dead and led to more than 4,000 suspects being arrested.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the violence police were accused of standing back, allowing rioters to think they could act with impunity, and thereby encouraging further unrest in other areas.</p>\n<p>But officers interviewed for the study said their tactics were misunderstood and that in the face of severe danger they were concentrating on what mattered most - safety.</p>\n<p>In Tottenham the outnumbered and under-equipped police on the ground when the violence broke out had to face a barrage of bricks, Molotov cocktails and other weapons for two hours before back-up arrived. </p>\n<p>\"We did everything that we possibly could with the resources that we had to try and protect life as well as property, but at some point I had to make the difficult decision it was life - it was always going to be life above property,\" Chief Inspector Ade Adelekan, who was in charge on the ground, told BBC Newsnight.</p>\n<p>Officers interviewed in the study reported seeing rioters armed with machetes and said that they were convinced that given the chance the rioters would kill them.</p>\n<p>Inspector Andre Ramsey, who led the police who reinforced the Tottenham officers, said his biggest fear had been of having a police officer separated from his or her colleagues, \"and if that had happened, I have absolutely no doubt that there could have been loss of life\".</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Riot police held back</span>\n<p id=\"story_continues_3\">The senior officers interviewed for the study, in particular in the Metropolitan Police, accept they struggled to deploy sufficient numbers of officers to contain the violence during all three days of rioting in London.</p>\n<p>Chief Superintendent Adrian Roberts, who was the Met's silver commander during the riots and conducted the forces' review of their response, admitted to Newsnight that whether there were enough police to deal with incidents \"almost became a lottery as to what time the disorder started and in what particular borough\".</p>\n<p>However, when asked about the claims that problems with radio systems left officers from other forces languishing in car parks rather than being deployed to the front line, Ch Supt Roberts said this was not a problem he was aware of.</p>\n<p>\"In fact the feedback that we'd had was that our airwave, which is the national system that we use, actually works very well and it was one of the things that did work very well for us.\"</p>\n<p>Ch Supt Roberts added that the Metropolitan Police did not have much experience of bringing in officers from outside, and that there were lessons to be learned, \"but I can assure that if I'd have known that cops were sitting in car parks they would have been deployed pretty quickly\". </p>\n<p>The officers in the study who said they were held back because of the radio problems said that were extremely frustrated by the experience. </p>\n<p>\"We're all sat in the van, we're taking phone calls from our loved ones, watching it all live on television - Croydon's on fire, the police are under attack in Hackney, and we're sat in a car park for the simple reason that we can't get onto the radio channel that they're operating on. </p>\n<p>\"In this day and age, I just think that's laughable,\" one said.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch Newsnight's full report on the findings of the LSE-Guardian Reading the Riots

drove off.</p>\n<p>He also followed the vehicle and even took a picture on his mobile phone, the court heard. The female driver, he told police, did not appear distressed.</p>\n<p>Ms Canavan said: \"The white female driver of the car, we say that's Ms Johnson, went over, picked up the Goodmans box and put it in the front seat of her car.\"</p>\n<p>\"He remembers seeing three black men running backwards and forwards to the car, putting things in it.\"</p>\n<p>On his way back from Chingford he went back to the retail park and spotted the car again, but this time it had been stopped by police. </p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Talk of gun'</span>\n<p>The witness approached the officers, just as they smashed Miss Johnson's windscreen, to stop her driving off after revving the engine, the court was told.</p>\n<p>The accused student had told police three boys jumped into her car and ordered her to drive, Ms Canavan said.</p>\n<p>In her defence case statement, Ms Johnson also said there was talk of stabbing people, talk of a gun, and one man had been playing footage on a mobile phone of someone being tortured.</p>\n<p>Ms Canavan said: \"The prosecution say, if what you are saying is true, the time to have said it is when you were safely with the police.</p>\n<p>\"Getting out and helping yourself to the Goodmans box discarded by one of the other individuals is hardly the action of someone who is being forced to drive around.\"</p>\n<p>The case

from private accounts belonging to Syria's first couple, although it admits it has not been possible to verify every one. </p>\n<p><strong>'Prudent'</strong></p>\n<p>They are said to have been intercepted by members of the Supreme Council of the Revolution between last June and early February, according to the Guardian. </p>\n<p>In one of the documents, dating from 19 December 2011, an email purporting to be from Mr Akhras to both Mr and Mrs Assad warns them that UK television network Channel Four was about to show footage of atrocities. </p>\n<p>Mr Akhras attaches a link to a Daily Mail article on the report, writing: \"The description of this video is horrible and the embassy were asked to comment but no answer\". </p>\n<p>He suggests it would be \"prudent\" for the embassy to \"respond and provide an explanation or comments e.g even by just saying the government will take the footage and pictures for professional examination and those accountable will be prosecuted\".</p>\n<p>He also suggests that Mr Assad should consider setting up a state-sponsored English-language television news network.</p>\n<p>Contacted by The Telegraph, Mr Akhras spoke of the situation in Homs, saying: \"When the London riots burst out and [British Prime Minister David] Cameron said he would get the army out, now would you compare that to Homs?\"</p>\n<p>\"What would you do? Just watch them killing you? You have a responsibility to ensure the security of your people.\" </p>\n<p>He admitted that the British authorities were able to deal with the riots without bloodshed, saying: \"We are not as sophisticated as the Metropolitan Police or Scotland Yard.\" </p>\n<p>Dr Akhras, a Harley Street cardiologist, has been a key liaison figure between the Syrian and British governments.</p>\n<p>He is also the founder and co-chairman of the British-Syrian Society, created in 2003 with the intention of strengthening ties between the two countries.</p>\n","updatedAt":1331897520,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"The father-in-law of the Syrian president has compared the Syrian army's crackdown in Homs, to the UK police's reponse to the

class=\"introduction\">Half of Londoners living in the areas worst affected in last summer's riots do not feel safe in part of their borough, a poll has suggested.</p>\n<p>The BBC London 94.9 poll, carried out by ComRes, surveyed 1,007 adults living in Croydon, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey and Southwark.</p>\n<p>Based on numbers of arrests and charges, they were the boroughs worst affected during the disorder.</p>\n<p>Some 50% of residents said they felt unsafe in part of their borough.</p>\n<p>The perception of danger was greatest in Hackney and Croydon, with 54% and 52% respectively saying an area there felt unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_1\">Councillor Sophie Linden, Hackney Council's cabinet member for crime, said: \"Crime in Hackney is at its lowest for 10 years, but it does concern me that residents could feel unsafe in some parts of the borough. </p>\n<p>\"We need to work harder with the police to make sure that residents feel safe in Hackney.\"</p>\n<p>A Croydon Council spokesman said: \"Despite what people might think, statistics show that people are really just as safe living in Croydon as they are in any similar part of London. </p>\n<p>\"We welcome every opportunity such as this to set the matter straight so that our residents and visitors can feel reassured.\"</p>\n<p>The riots initially began with a protest against the killing of Mark Duggan during an armed vehicle stop.</p>\n<p>But three-quarters of people polled felt that the police are on the side of ordinary people in their local area. </p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Scope to improve'</span>\n<p>Confidence in the police was lowest in Hackney (68%).</p>\n<p>Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley of the Metropolitan Police said: \"Regardless of the headlines we see regularly it is reassuring to know three-quarters of the people questioned for the BBC survey recognised the police were on their side. </p>\n<p>\"Of course, there is always scope to improve and our commitment to total policing means a relentless war on crime and care for victims.</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\">\"I hope those people who feel there are areas that they don't feel safe to go speak to their local police so that their concerns can be addressed.\"</p>\n<p>But the majority of Londoners (56%) did not think that politicians or local councils cared about helping local residents.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for London Councils, which represents the capital's local authorities, said: \"For councils across London the riots were an unprecedented challenge.  </p>\n<p>\"Local authorities were essential to the recovery, responding speedily to clean up the streets, help businesses recover and restore social cohesion. </p>\n<p>\"Since last August councils have been working closely with local people to identify what more needs to be done to improve their neighbourhoods.\" </p>\n<p>Some 200 demographically representative people were surveyed in each of the boroughs.</p>\n","updatedAt":1331706600,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Half of Londoners living in the areas worst affected in last summer's riots do not feel safe in part of their borough, a poll has

murder charge over Richard Bowes death","body":"<p class=\"introduction\">The prosecution in the case of the death of a pensioner during the London riots has accepted a guilty plea of manslaughter by a 17-year-old boy.</p>\n<p>Darrell Desuze, of Bath Road, Hounslow, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Richard Mannington Bowes on Monday.</p>\n<p>Mr Bowes, 68, was punched and fell to the ground as he tried to stamp out a fire in Spring Bridge Road in Ealing, west London, on 8 August.</p>\n<p>He suffered brain damage when his head hit the pavement. </p>\n<p>An order banning the identification of the teenager was lifted at Inner London Crown Court.</p>\n<p>Desuze had previously admitted burglaries on the day of the crime at William Hill, Tesco Express, Blockbusters and Fatboys Thai restaurant.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Catastrophic brain injuries'</span>\n<p>The court heard Mr Bowes was taken from the scene near his home in Haven Green, Ealing, but was pronounced dead in hospital.</p>\n<p>Mr Justice Saunders said in terms of consequences, it was the most serious crime committed during the riots and the public had a right to know what happened and who killed the retired accountant.</p>\n<p>Desuze, who a year before the riots went on a school trip to the Metropolitan Police's riot training centre in Gravesend to watch a simulated riot, still faces a charge of murder but the Crown will not pursue it and it is expected to lie on file.</p>\n<p>Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said on the evening of the killing Desuze, known as Smokey, set off for Harrow with friends.</p>\n<p>They headed to Ealing after getting a text from someone anticipating trouble there.</p>\n<p>Desuze, wearing sunglasses and a distinctive top saying \"Robbers and Villains\", was caught on camera kicking in the glass doors of a shopping centre before joining a mob that attacked police with missiles around Spring Bridge Road.</p>\n<p>Mr Altman said: \"But one thing distinguished him from the others. He killed Richard Bowes, an entirely innocent local resident who had intervened to extinguish flames and prevent a fire in one of the bins.\"</p>\n<p>The barrister said left-handed Desuze threw his full weight behind a punch to Mr Bowes's jaw, buckling his legs, knocking him unconscious and backwards where his head took the full force of impact on the road.</p>\n<p>The police were \"simply unable to reach Mr Bowes for some minutes because of the violence against them,\" said Mr Altman.</p>\n<p>After walking off, Desuze returned to the victim and moved him on to the pavement.</p>\n<p>\"If it was concern for what he had done, it was short-lived,\" said Mr Altman.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of calling an ambulance or summoning any of the policemen around, he was in minutes rejoining the riot.\"</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_1\">Mr Bowes sustained \"catastrophic brain injuries\" and never regained consciousness.</p>\n<p>Desuze's mother, Lavinia Desuze, 31, will stand trial on Monday accused of perverting the course of justice by destroying the clothes her son wore on the night of the killing.</p>\n<p>She appeared at court and chose to stay in the dock with Desuze after her case was adjourned.</p>\n<p>Desuze will be sentenced next month after pre-sentencing reports have been completed.</p>\n<p>Speaking after the hearing, Det Ch Supt Andy Rowell said: \"Mr Bowes was out on the street where he lived trying to do the right thing and paid a terrible price for doing so, leaving his friends and relatives devastated by the loss.</p>\n<p>\"Although of little comfort, those that knew him can be justifiably proud of his sense of right and wrong, and his bravery in challenging the behaviour that he witnessed that night.\"</p>\n","updatedAt":1331646600,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"The prosecution in the case of the death of a pensioner during the London riots has accepted a guilty plea of manslaughter by a

five officers reported problems with radio signals and patchy radio reception across London.</p>\n<p>More than 200 officers worked for more than three weeks without a day off, including 15 who worked all 31 days of August, with many suffering from the effects of burn-out, the report stated.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Defective equipment</span>\n<p>Almost half (3,859 or 45%) said they suffered fatigue and one in six (1,407, 16%) said they suffered stress. But one in five (1,798, 21%) said they experienced \"no ill effects\".</p>\n<p>The report said: \"These symptoms could have had an effect on the command and control process of police deployments.</p>\n<p>\"It was clear that many officers were angry at the way their safety and welfare had been compromised through protracted tours of duty with insufficient or defective equipment and little welfare support.\"</p>\n<p>Peter Smyth, the federation's chairman, said: \"Met bosses must as a matter of urgency ensure that enough properly equipped vehicles are available for deployment.</p>\n<p>\"The use of so many hire vehicles in particular was staggeringly inappropriate for the role they had to play leaving officers in these vehicles with little projection from projectiles or the rioters themselves.</p>\n<p>\"All police officers understand the exceptional nature of the riots, which is why so many of us were willing to give 110% during the crisis working for weeks without days off and sleeping on station floors.</p>\n<p>\"But it is completely unacceptable when a lack of safe equipment left officers at real risk of unnecessary harm during their duties or unable to help colleagues in danger.\"</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Fit for purpose'</span>\n<p>Lessons from the Front Line, a report on the Met's Operation Kirkin, called for Scotland Yard to review the equipment available to officers during public order deployments and for more welfare support for officers.</p>\n<p>Police chiefs should consider the quality of friction lock batons, carry out a full audit of long and short shields, and ensure \"sufficient equipped vehicles are fit for purpose and available\", it said.</p>\n<p>The report also called for a review of \"the quantity, quality and nutritional value of food\", as well as \"where and how officers are fed\".</p>\n<p>It comes after a leaked internal report on how UK forces responded to the disorder which swept across English cities last summer said police were forced to use their own mobile phones when radios failed.</p>\n","updatedAt":1331137620,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Officers were put at \"unnecessary

id=\"story_continues_1\">Riots could erupt if police cut ties with journalists after the phone-hacking scandal, a former Metropolitan Police chief told the Leveson Inquiry.</p>\n<p>Lord Stevens said not using the media to explain police actions after an incident like a police shooting could lead to \"massive public disorder\".</p>\n<p>He said Scotland Yard officers had become \"absolutely terrified\" of speaking to the press.</p>\n<p>Lord Stevens was the Met Commissioner between 2000 and 2005.</p>\n<p>He told the inquiry into press standards it was vital for forces to communicate with the public as soon as possible after an incident that had the potential to increase community tensions.</p>\n<p>\"If you do not deal with that very, very quickly indeed, in terms of saying why you have been involved in a shooting or why you've done the actions you've done, then the whole thing will just escalate in a way that leads to massive public disorder,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"The message must be out there as quickly as you can of why the police did what they did, and the media have to be the major part of doing that.\"</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Absolutely terrified'</span>\n<p>Responding to the suggestion the Met had become reluctant to engage with the media, Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked: \"Are you suggesting that there has been an over-reaction, that the pendulum has swung too far in one direction in relation to recent events?\"</p>\n<p>Lord Stevens replied: \"What I have heard, people are absolutely terrified of picking up a phone or speaking to the press in any way, shape or form. I don't think that's healthy.</p>\n<p>\"The press have a job to do. They deliver on occasions some outstanding work - especially investigative journalism, and sometimes there has to be a relationship between the police and the media for the right reasons.\"</p>\n<p>Lord Stevens did not refer specifically to the killing of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, last August, which sparked rioting across England.</p>\n<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission and Scotland Yard have apologised for mishandling the way they dealt with his family.</p>\n<p>The former commissioner gave the example of the shooting of painter and decorator Harry Stanley in Hackney, east London, in September 1999 by officers who mistook a table leg he was holding in a bag for a gun.</p>\n<p>He said: \"It's very important to get down there as quickly as you can, and sometimes take a fair bit of abuse, as I certainly did in Hackney when I went down there.\"</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Over-reaction warning</span>\n<p>Asked about the force's inquiry into phone hacking after he had left, he said he found it \"difficult to criticise\" but added he hoped as commissioner he would have been \"quite ruthless\" in pursuing the allegations.</p>\n<p>Scotland Yard has been widely criticised for failing to reopen the phone hacking investigation in 2009 after the Guardian published a story  alleging the illegal practice was far more prevalent than previously believed.</p>\n<p>Lord Stevens terminated a contract to write columns at the News of the World at &pound;7,000 per article in October 2007 over concerns about the phone-hacking convictions.</p>\n<p>\"I would never have written the articles if I had known what I now know,\" he said. </p>\n<p>Earlier, former Met chief Lord Condon said a \"massive bureaucratic over-reaction\" of police having to record all contact with the media should be avoided.</p>\n<p>Lord Condon, Met commissioner between 1993 and 2000, told the inquiry there had to be clear rules of engagement for the police's dealings with journalists.</p>\n<p>During his time there was a \"small but significant\" number of officers whose behaviour was \"totally unacceptable\".</p>\n<p>He told the inquiry that accepting hospitality could be the start of a \"grooming process\" which leads to \"inappropriate and unethical behaviour\".</p>\n<p>Lynne Owens, chief constable of Surrey Police, formerly of the Met, told the inquiry she did not want to risk meeting press in a social setting, which journalists found \"slightly strange\".  </p>\n<p>Responding to Robert Jay QC's comment that this was an \"extremely austere approach,\" she said it was \"entirely appropriate\".</p>\n","updatedAt":1331057760,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Riots could erupt if police cut ties with journalists

riots: Student 'forgives Good Samaritan attackers'","body":"<p class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">A student robbed by two men who pretended to help him during last summer's riots has said people should forgive his attackers. </p>\n<p>Ashraf Rossli, 21, had been in Britain for a month when he was knocked to the ground and had his jaw broken and bicycle stolen in Barking. </p>\n<p>As he lay injured, John Kafunda, 22, of Ilford, and Reece Donovan, 24, of Romford, stole items from his bag.</p>\n<p>Mr Rossli, from Malaysia, said he was not angry with the men.</p>\n<p>His attackers were caught after footage - which showed Kafunda lifting their victim up after he was attacked and Donovan riffling through his bag and stealing a PSP games console and 10 games worth &pound;500 - was posted on YouTube and broadcast on news channels around the world.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the Malaysian High Commission in central London, Mr Rossli said he just wanted to get on with his life.</p>\n<p id=\"story_continues_2\">\"My jaw is healed now so there is no point worrying about them,\" he explained.</p>\n<p>\"When you make some mistakes it is best to be punished but I want people to forgive them because when you put yourself in that situation you don't want to be judged by the same mistake your whole life.</p>\n<p>\"People make mistakes, so forgive them.\"</p>\n<p>On Friday, Kafunda and Donovan were found guilty at Wood Green Crown Court, of robbery and violent disorder. </p>\n<p>Donovan was also convicted of theft and the burgling of a Tesco store.</p>\n<p>The men are due to be sentenced on 13 March. </p>\n<p>Beau Isagba, 17, of Ilford, was convicted of punching the 5ft 4ins student in the face, smashing his jaw and leaving the scene after stealing his bicycle.</p>\n<p>When asked if he wanted to see the men behind bars, Mr Rossli said: \"If that's the possible outcome then yeah.\"</p>\n<p>The accountancy student, who now has metal plates in his jaw, said he was grateful for all the support he had received.</p>\n<p>He said the experience had not made him think less of the UK and he is no longer afraid of being in crowds here, although he no longer cycles around the capital.</p>\n<p>He added he was planning to stay in Britain to work after he had finished his studies.</p>\n<p>\"There are a lot of people that don't want bad things, they want peace and harmony,\" he said. </p>\n<p>\"There are people that are nice and people that are bad and they are a minority.</p>\n<p>\"The only thing that concerned me was that I wanted somebody to fix my jaw. </p>\n<p>\"Now that it is all healed I don't have any grudge against [the attackers] whatsoever.

riots: The YouTube mugging that shocked Britain","body":"<p class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">Two men posing as Good Samaritans have been convicted of robbing a Malaysian student who had been attacked and had his jaw broken during last year's riots. The whole incident was captured on CCTV. </p>\n<p>The shaky video footage is less than 30 seconds long, but captures one of the most notorious and memorable incidents of last August's riots. </p>\n<p>It begins with a group of apparently sympathetic youths helping a bleeding mugging victim to his feet - a moment of tenderness amid the waves of violence that hit England's towns and cities.</p>\n<p>But what happens next is far from an act of kindness.</p>\n<p>As the dazed young man makes an attempt to stagger to his feet, the apparent good Samaritans lean in, open his rucksack, and take his belongings. </p>\n<p>But what the attackers do not realise is that the entire incident has been caught on camera.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">'Moral vacuum'</span>\n<p>The video was soon posted on file-sharing site YouTube, and rapidly seen by millions of people worldwide. </p>\n<p>What followed was a wave of repulsion, and the prime minister held up the incident as a powerful symbol of \"Broken Britain\".</p>\n<p>\"When we see the disgusting sight of an injured young man with people pretending to help him while they are robbing him, it is clear there are things that are badly wrong in our society,\" said David Cameron.</p>\n<p>The 8 August attack in Barking, east London, made global headlines and became one of the defining images of the disorder.</p>\n<p>Giles Fraser, the then canon chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, said the video had a powerful effect because it encapsulated the \"moral vacuum that was at the heart of the unrest\".</p>\n<p>A hunt to track down the victim - and his assailants - began, and slowly, more details emerged.</p>\n<p>The injured teenager was revealed as 20-year-old Malaysian student Ashraf Hazier Rossli, who had only recently arrived in Britain. </p>\n<p>He was on his way to buy food to break his Ramadan fast when he became caught up in the riots.</p>\n<p>He was set upon by Beau Isagba, 17, who broke his jaw in two places and knocked him off his bicycle.  </p>\n<p>As he sat dazed and in a pool of blood the youths seen in the video gathered around him. </p>\n<p>Reece Donovan, 22, and John Kafunda, 22, took his mobile phone, wallet and a Sony games console with a number of games.</p>\n<p>Mr Rossli later told their trial: \"I was sat on the pavement with blood pouring from my mouth. I remember being approached by a male who asked if I was okay. I remember being pulled to my feet, then I felt someone tugging at my rucksack.</p>\n<p>\"I was not in a position to defend myself and was still suffering from the effects of being hit. I knew they were stealing from me but I could do nothing.\"</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Caught red-handed</span>\n<p>Donovan and Kafunda were caught red-handed on the CCTV footage but both swore blind it was not them.</p>\n<p>Kafunda told police he was \"a million per cent sure\" he was not the man in the film seen talking to Mr Rossli while his accomplice rifles his rucksack.</p>\n<p>\"If that was me I would physically stop them but that isn't me there,\" he told detectives who confronted him with the video evidence.</p>\n<p>The jury did not believe him and both Kafunda and Donovan were convicted of robbery and violent disorder. Donovan was also found guilty of burglary from Tesco in Barking on the same day.</p>\n<p>They are due to be sentenced next month, as is Isagba, who was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm and stealing Mr Rossli's bike. </p>\n<p>Mr Rossli was taken to the Royal London Hospital and after treatment for his injuries the magnanimity of what he had to say appeared a world away from the actions of his mean-spirited attackers.</p>\n<p>The shaken finance student, from Kuala Lumpur, told reporters at a press conference: \"I feel very sorry for the people who did this. </p>\n<p>\"It was really sad because among them were children.\"</p>\n<p>As Mr Rossli was roundly praised for his positive attitude, a huge internet campaign was launched to support him.</p>\n<p>In the days that followed a site named <a href=\"http://somethingniceforashraf.tumblr.com/\">Let's Do Something Nice For Ashraf</a> was set up, along with countless Facebook groups, and messages from well-wishers poured in.  </p>\n<p>A message on the original site now simply states the incident was a \"shameful way for a guest in our country to be treated\" and says thousands of people have donated to the cause.</p>\n<p>More than &pound;22,000 was raised for Mr Rossli but he pledged to give away half of that sum to other victims of the violence.</p>\n<span class=\"cross-head\">Front-page news</span>\n<p>He was later named as one of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088386_2088390_2088391,00.html\">10 Heroes of the London Riots</a> by Time magazine.</p>\n<p>After the verdict, Chief Supt Gary Buttercase, temporary borough commander at Barking and Dagenham, described Mr Rossli as \"a man of humility and dignity and a tremendous credit to his country\".</p>\n<p>\"I am particularly pleased that we have managed to get justice for the appalling attack he suffered and the subsequent theft that has attracted derision from across the world,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Rahimy Abd Rahim, of the Malaysian Star newspaper, the first news organisation to track down Mr Rossli, said there had been extensive coverage of the riots in his country.</p>\n<p>The reporter said Mr Rossli's story appeared on the front page of every national newspaper and he became a \"local hero\".</p>\n<p>Despite the adverse coverage, Mr Rahim said he did not believe the attack had altered Malaysia's view of Britain, which is a popular place to study for Malaysians. There are about 12,500 Malaysian students in the UK; about 4,000 of them government-sponsored.</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe that the UK's image has been tainted since the attack. It was clearly an isolated case,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Malaysians will continue to visit and study in the UK despite the incident.\"</p>\n","updatedAt":1330700820,"publishedAt":null,"intro":"Two men posing as Good Samaritans have been convicted of robbing a Malaysian student who had been attacked and had his jaw broken during last year's riots.
